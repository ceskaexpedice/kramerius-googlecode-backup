<strong>What do I find in a Digital library?</strong><br><br>
The Digital library contains valuable and endangered documents in a digital form from
Memoriae Mundi Series Bohemica program (namely manuscripts, old prints and
prospectively other documents) and from Kramerius program (older newspapers and
journals and other valuable documents printed on an acidic paper). The access to the
Digital library is limited to users with access privileges. Metadata, i.e. bibliographical and
other descriptions of documents are accessible to all users as well as image document
data exempt from Copyright Act protection. Image document data under the protection
of Copyright Act are accessible only to users using PC located at the premises of the
National Library CR.

<strong>What do I need to be able to work with a Digital library?</strong><br><br>
You need a web browser - Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 + is recommended or any other
compatible browser. You need to install a plug-in module to be able to work with images
in  <a href="http://digit.nkp.cz/knihcin/projekty/Digit/DjVu-help-cz.html" target="_blank">DjVu</a>
format. The advantage of this format is lower amount of transmitted data and ability
to manipulate the image (maximize/minimize?) in the main browser using the aforementioned
plug-in. We recommend you a screen resolution of 1024 x 728 pixels and higher. If you
have a lower resolution problems might occur in manipulating the image files.
<p>
Access to the document pages follows the structure of these documents that is at first you
are offered a bibliographical entry from which you proceed to sub layers of the documents
(years, copies, particular pages). A level that you are in is always displayed on the menu
located on the left side.

  <strong>Searching documents</strong><br><br>
  Searching allows easier discovery of the requested document. It runs over descriptive metadata for all types 
  of documents including fulltext searching in page texts. 
  The searching functionality is available on two places:
  <ul>
    <li>search field on the top of the welcome view and alphabet view</li>
    <li>search field on the bottom of the left menu</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Searching is applied to all types of documents. The results may be filtered with tabs that selects 
  onle those results that are of selected type. If the search is performed for example during browsing the periodicals, 
  the search will be automatically filtered to contain only periodicals. Searching is performed on these fields: <br><br> 
  <em>Periodicals:</em> 
  <ol>
    <li>ISSN
    <li>Main title, Sub-Title, Parallel title
    <li>First and last name of the authors, First and last name of the contributors
    <li>Publisher, Printer
    <li>Date of publishing, Date of printing
    <li>Shelf number
    <li>Storage place 
    <li>Periodical volume number, Periodical item number
    <li>Text content of the pages
  </ol>

  <em>Monographs:</em> 
  <ol>
    <li>ISBN
    <li>Main title, Sub-Title, Parallel title
    <li>First and last name of the authors, First and last name of the contributors
    <li>Publisher, Printer
    <li>Date of publishing, Date of printing
    <li>Shelf number
    <li>Storage place
    <li>Text content of the pages
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p><em>Performing the search</em><br>

  The search field may be filled with words separated by space. These words are used for searching and 
  are joined with AND logical operator by default. The mode may be changed by entering logical operators between 
  the words. The expressions can be grouped with brackets.<br>
  <em>AND</em> - to search in AND mode, all the entered words have to be included (e.g. 'Česká AND republika')<br>
  <em>OR</em> - to search in OR mode, some of the entered words have to be included (e.g. 'Česká OR republika')<br>
  <em>NOT</em> - to avoid the following word (e.g. 'republika NOT Česká' will find only texts including 'republika' and not including 'Česká')<br>

  <em>"exact phrase"</em> - to search for exact phrase the words may be enclosed inside double apostrophes (e. g. "skákal pes přes")<br>
  </p>
  <p><em>Viewing and filtering the results</em><br>
  The search may be run by SEARCH button after entering the words into the search field.
  After that the search results page is diplayed with results sorted by the score. Every result contains 
  a link to appropriate document. Search results may be filtered by tabs. The <em>All</em> tab will
  display all results, the <em>Periodical</em> tab will diplay only periodical results etc. 
  </p>

  <p><em>Advanced search</em><br>
  Advanced search may be used to enter specific value for each metadata field. For example you
  may search only for authors or titles. The search query of advanced search can be customized 
  in results view and run again (you do not have to go back to advanced search view). 
  If more than one field is filled with a value, these sub-queries are linked with AND operator 
  which is default. If you need an OR operator, result query may be modified in a similar way:<br>
  <em>author:(novák) title:(slovník)</em> <br>to<br> <em>author:(novák) OR title:(slovník)</em>
  </p>

  contain links that points directly to the page representation. The results may contain 
  text snippets with highlighted occurences of the searched words. The page for 
  advanced searching allows the user to specify similarity of words matching. The similarity may be set 
  using a combo box with 10% to 100% values (example: when 70% 
  is specified for searched word 'historie', results with 'historií', 'historik' či 'historika' words are returned).
